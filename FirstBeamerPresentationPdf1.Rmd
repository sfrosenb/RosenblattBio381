## Complete Data is Rare: \newline Regular Issues with Census Data

- Unwilling to be interviewed

\bigskip

- Contact details secret even among partners

\bigskip

- Population members inaccessible
    - Incarcerated
    - Homeless (no address)



## Complete Data is Rare: \newline Hidden Population Example - Colorado Springs

- At least 44% of nodes missing (out of those found eligible for the study)

\bigskip

- At least 88% of nodes with incomplete local network data

\bigskip

- These are generous lower bounds




## Complete Data is Rare: \newline Impact on Centrality Measures

## Stochastic Strategies
>- 1: Randomly sample from node list 
>- 2: Investigate local network around randomly sampled node
>- 3: Nodes are found to be central if they are frequently found to be locally important


## True Network vs Known Network
