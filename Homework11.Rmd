Ok so there are a bunch of plots here but the only one I remember working on is the last one at the bottom, which took me an entire day to make and which I will be using something like in my actual research. I am going to leave in the other plots in case they were actually things I worked on, but I think they may have just been your code that I pasted in here while working on my plot for a convenient example to work from

# testing patchwork
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- qplot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
p2 <- qplot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)
p1 + p2 # Error: Don't know how to add p2 to a plot (if patchwork is not installed)

#Possibly alternately I could use the outline of the dot to indicate direction and use fill to indicate magnitude. This might clear up issues with very light blue looking like very light red, which I used the dot outline to make clearer
